            <p class="lead text-center">What do the basic laws of physics describe? Why 
                is the state of a classical particle identified by position and momentum (i.e. a point
                on a cotangent bundle) while the state of a quantum system is identified by a
                wave function (i.e. a vector in a Hilbert space)? Could we have had different laws?</p>
            <p class="lead text-center"><b><i>The project aims to identify a handful of physical principles
                        from which the basic laws can be rigorously derived.</i></b></p>
            <p>We believe this approach allows us to answer the 
                above questions as it forces us to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Clarify our assumptions.</b> As we are forced to formalize and make explicit our starting points,
                    we understand under which conditions each physical theory is valid. We also have a better
                    idea of when and how they fail, possibly giving new insights that may lead to new physics.</li>
                <li><b>Put physics back at the center of the discussion.</b> By starting from physical ideas we put physics
                    back at the center of the discussion, instead of relegating it to a mere after-the-fact interpretation
                    as it is currently done in most modern scientific theories. Many results can be directly understood
                    in terms of the assumptions, fostering a better intuition for the mathematical results.</li>
                <li><b>Give science sturdier mathematical grounds.</b> As each mathematical symbol is given a precise physical meaning,
                    our formal framework maps one-to-one to our physical understanding.
                    This means we automatically leave out any unphysical mathematical artifact.</li>
                <li><b>Foster connections between different fields of knowledge.</b> We have found recurring core concepts 
                    between different fields of science, math, philosophy and engineering. In retrospect, this is not surprising: nature
                    is one and does not care about such divisions, and therefore truly fundamental concepts must span freely across
                    different areas.</li>
                <li><b>Provides a way to pose deep questions.</b> Once we have formalized what we mean by scientific theory and 
                    identified what conditions are required to rederive the basic laws, we can try to understand whether those
                    requirements are statements about the world around us or are statements about what is needed to do science.</li>

                <p>There has always been an effort to formalize a physical theory from a small set
                    of well defined physics principles or laws. Newtonian mechanics, special relativity and thermodynamics,
                    for example, follow that pattern. Unfortunately, this practice has stopped in modern times.
                    Lagrangian mechanics and Quantum mechanics, for example, simply
                    posit the mathematical structure without a clear justification as to what is physically described
                    and why those rules exist. Physics is recovered at a later stage, by "interpreting" the results
                    of the mathematical theory.</p>
                <p>In this project we want to revert back to that original spirit and put the physics at the center of our physical theories.
                    We want to identify those physical starting points, our physical assumptions, and then derive
                    the mathematical framework as a necessary consequence. By proceeding in this fashion, it is
                    always clear under what conditions a particular theory can be assumed to be valid, it is clear
                    what mathematical structure are physically meaningful and what are just artifacts introduced
                    by mathematicians to make calculations or proofs easier to develop. It also allows us to think
                    more deeply about our starting points, leading to new insights and possible new approaches.</p>

                <p>The foundations of mathematics settled during the beginning of the 20th century. Work by
                    Cantor, Russel, Zermelo, Fraenkel, Godel and many others re-organized the whole discipline
                    on top of logic and set theory. During that period physics was tackling new ideas in
                    both theory and experiment, which lead to general relativity and quantum mechanics, and 
                    never really took that step at fully identifying the formal foundations of its discipline.</p>
                <p> In this project we establish a general mathematical theory for experimental science,
                    which aims to axiomatize the underpinning of all scientific disciplines in the same way
                    that logic and axiomatic set theory establishes the underpinning of all modern math.
                    The core concept is the idea of an experimentally verifiable statement: an assertion that,
                    if true, can be verified to be so in a finite amount of time. We establish the logic of
                    these objects and we see how they lead to topologies and sigma-algebras. A physical theory,
                    then, is simply a collection of verifiable statement with a well defined semantic relationship
                    between them.</p>
                <p> Uncovering the assumptions of physics means understanding how a physical assumption
                    is formally captured by the semantic relationship between statements, and how those relationships
                    necessarily lead to a given mathematical structure.</p>

                <p>Over the last century, there has been an increasing interest within philosophy of
                    science on the foundations of the physical theories. Particularly in quantum mechanics,
                    the effort is to better characterize the mathematical structure describing the theory
                    in terms of "real" ontological entities. The main issue here is that the same mathematical
                    equation can be used to describe different physical systems (e.g. linear systems are used
                    in electronics, thermodynamics, biology, etc...) and the same physical system can be
                    described by different mathematical structures (e.g. a massive point particle can be modeled
                    by a point in a cotangent bundle or by a point in a tangent bundle).</p>
                <p>In this project we develop the mathematical structures of science starting by clearly defining the physical
                    objects we are studying, with particular attention to the philosophical aspects that
                    arise with those definitions. As we do this from the very beginning, we are forced
                    to clarify many aspects that are usually "swept under the rug". As everything else is
                    built on top these definitions, the mathematical structures have one clear meaning and 
                    there are no issue of interpretation. This provides a better framework to understand
                    what science is, what the laws of physics are and what they can or cannot be describing.</p>

                            distinguished. It must keep track of what can be verified (a topology), what can be predicted (a sigma-algebra) and a

                            Deterministic and reversible evolution can only move the density from one state to another without changing it and must
                            conserve the number of states as they evolve. That is: each infinitesimal part evolves according to Hamilton's equations

                            the correlation between the random variables will result into constructive and descructive interference. Deterministic and
                            reversible evolution will preserve the total amount of material (unitary evolution) and therefore evolves according to the Schroedinger equation.</td>
